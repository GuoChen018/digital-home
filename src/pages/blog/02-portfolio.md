## Why a new portfolio?

Creating a new portfolio every year has been a tradition for me. Here are the main reasons:

### 1. To test my skills

I felt like this portfolio was the ultimate test of my design & dev skills up to this point. I wanted to design a portfolio I’m truly proud of. I also wanted to code it from scratch, which is something I’ve never done before. From the start, I knew I’d learn so much from this redesign.

### 2. Update my projects

I wanted to showcase all my proudest works. I felt like it was a bit limiting to showcase only one project from each company. At first, I was a bit hesitant because it’s different from how normal portfolio display their work. But, after asking a mentor and seeing other successful examples, I decided to go for it.

<!-- <video src="/images/blog/portfolio/hover-on-project.mov" muted autoplay loop></video> -->


<!-- ```javascript 

item.addEventListener('mouseleave', () => {
    tooltip.classList.remove('show');
    tooltip.remove();
    
``` -->

## Guidelines for myself

Before I began, I set a few guidelines for myself.

### 1. Code from scratch

In the past, I’ve coded small sites such as an anime site and resource gallery. But, I have never coded my portfolio before. So, this was the most challenging part for me as a designer. Here is the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/GuoChen018/digital-home).

### 2. Don’t be afraid to be myself

I wanted this portfolio to “feel” like me. The illustrations. The vibe. The colors. The details. I want to sprinkle in different glimpses of me: Who I am, what I love, and what I care about.

### 3. Focus on accessibility

This is a shoutout to my mentor: [Mike Mai](https://mikemai.net/). He was my mentor when I was at [Pega](https://www.pega.com/), and he introduced me to the world of accessibility. Honestly, my new portfolio isn’t my proudest work on accessibility. I felt like there’s still a lot I missed/forgot, but I guess the point here is to learn by doing.

### 4. Focus on craft

It’s hard to define what craft means. I think it comes down to a mix of attention to detail, intentional decisions, aesthetics, care, refinement, etc.

## Inspirations

### Isometric art

There’s just something special about isometric art. Maybe it’s the sense of order. Balance. Straight lines.

![A gallery of different pixel art illustrations](/images/blog/02-portfolio/pixel.jpg)

### Clean, light interfaces

I was greatly inspired by minimal interfaces and designs. Some examples are [Rachel](https://rachelbeen.com/), [Emil](https://emilkowal.ski/), [Gavin](https://nelson.co/), [Anton](https://repponen.com/), [Alim](https://www.withalim.com/), [typo](https://typo.by/), [Attio](https://attio.com/), [Family](https://family.co/), etc. I gasped when I saw [Harry Atkin’s website](https://harryjatkins.com/).

![Harry Atkin's portfolio](/images/blog/02-portfolio/harry.jpg)

## Design iterations

I won’t go over each of them, but here is a gallery of the different iterations I went over.

![First iteration of the portfolio. There is a centered aligned intro and a 3D cube with hand-drawn figures below](/images/blog/02-portfolio/iteration-1.jpg)

![Second iteration of the portfolio. There is a left aligned intro and an isometric city illustration below](/images/blog/02-portfolio/iteration-2.jpg)

![Third iteration of the portfolio. There is a left navigation and right section with projects and blog post](/images/blog/02-portfolio/iteration-3.jpg)

## Final design + considerations

### Home page

![Guo's portfolio home page with centered aligned intro and an isometric illustration of different objects below](/images/blog/02-portfolio/final-design.jpg)

#### Hero illustration + interactions

The isometric grid and objects are not 3D. I drew all of them in Affinity Designer.

![Affinity designer's isometric view](/images/blog/02-portfolio/affinity.jpg)

At first, I tried to draw them in Figma. But discovering Affinity Designer’s isometric view, I never looked back. It was super fun to think of different personal objects and draw them out.

After I drew the objects and grid lines in Affinity Designer, I copied and pasted them in Figma to set up the scene. This was because I wanted to include the “id” attribute when exporting SVG from Figma. This helped a lot when organizing my SVG later in code.

The hover interaction on the isometric objects was inspired by [Shape](https://shape.samuelkraft.com/), a workout calendar built by [Samuel](https://twitter.com/samuelkraft). When you hover over the text “modern and fast,” you’ll know what I mean.

#### Project gallery

The purpose of this section is to showcase many UI shots for each project. I took inspiration from [Alim](https://www.withalim.com/), [Dimitri](https://dimitriknight.com/), [Joseph](https://www.josephz.me/), and [Marco](https://www.marco.fyi/).

About image hover, I really like [Perry’s project hover](https://www.perryw.ca/). So I created something a bit similar.

<video src="/images/blog/02-portfolio/hover-on-project.mp4" muted autoplay loop></video>

Lastly, I saw Mitchell Clement’s LinkedIn post titled “[Most Case Study Titles are Boring](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mitchell-clements_most-case-study-titles-are-boring-activity-7163185087172296704-Rmw0?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).” I really liked his advice on showing the scope of work or leading with the outcome in titles. So, I changed all my titles.

### Case study

I won’t go into each specific case study, so I’ll point out some of the details.

#### Two column layout

This was largely inspired by [Perry](https://www.perryw.ca/), [Joseph](https://www.josephz.me/), and [Natalie’s](https://www.nataliealmosa.ca/) portfolio. The two-column layout prevents my paragraph from stretching too long.

![Two column layout in Guo's portfolio](/images/blog/02-portfolio/two-column.jpg)

#### Screen recordings

I used [Screen Studio](https://www.screen.studio/) for the UI recordings. One of the best investments I’ve made (also got a student discount). The hardest part was definitely planning the recording sequence.

![Recording sequence in a notion document](/images/blog/02-portfolio/recording-sequence.jpg)

#### Image caption

I’ve been dying to use [Commit Mono](https://commitmono.com/) somewhere in my portfolio. It’s such a beautiful mono font. I figured the image caption would be a good place to use it, and I’m glad I did.

#### Laying out the structure and prepping images

For each of my case studies, I would write a Notion doc writing down the entire structure and images needed. It did get draining often, but I found this practice to be extremely helpful when implemented.

![Notion document with a case study's structure](/images/blog/02-portfolio/notion-doc.jpg)

In terms of the image assets, I designed them all in Figma. Then, I exported each of them 1.5x or 2x for a better image quality. I would export PNG for transparent background and JPG otherwise. Lastly, I would compress all of them using [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/).

For Inko Cat alone, I created 30 different image assets.

![Scattered gallery of inko cat assets](/images/blog/02-portfolio/inko-cat-assets.jpg)

### About page

The interesting part about the About page was that I didn’t have a concrete design before implementing it.

So, I’ll delve more into this page later.

## Development + considerations

With most of the designs completed, I dived into the code.

### How I built it

HTML, CSS, JavaScript (JS), and Astro — This was my tech stack.

I wanted to familiarize myself with the basics and not get too fancy (Next JS has some serious clout/rizz). About Astro, I simply wanted to try it out. And looking back, I don’t think I used even 10% of its full capability.

#### Helpful resources

Along the way, I read and watched a lot of resources. Here are the ones that I found useful:

- [Kevin Powell](https://youtu.be/acgIGT0J99U?si=h1BuZtdiaVRSdFR9)
- [Astro documentation](https://astro.new/latest)
- [Coding in Public](https://youtu.be/6XzyobQYQVQ?si=6lPhG5mbrM7MhriL)
- [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/@WebDevSimplified/videos)

### Details

Next, I want to delve into specific implementation details. Below are the ones I feel are worth highlighting:

#### Hover tooltip

<video src="/images/blog/02-portfolio/hover-illustration-tooltip.mp4" muted autoplay loop></video>

To achieve this effect, I used a mix of `data-tooltip-content` and JS.

```html

<g id="ping-pong" data-tooltip-content='<div class="tooltip-content"><figure class="tooltip-fig"><div class="skeleton"></div><video class="tooltip-icon" muted autoplay loop src="../images/hero/[table-tennis-720s.mp](http://table-tennis-720s.mp/)4"></video></figure><p class="tooltip-text">I used to play table tennis competitively (8 years)!</p></div>'
</g>

```

The `data-tooltip-content` was relatively straightforward. But now, the question was:

> How do I display these when I hover over the objects?
> 

At the time, I legit did not know how to do this. So, I went to [Claude AI](https://claude.ai/) and asked how to do it.

After several back and forths and me trying to understand the code, it came up with the JS code to make it work:

```javascript

const svgItems = document.querySelectorAll('#spaceship, #laptop, #ping-pong, #microphone, #cup, #pencil, #cat, #pencil, #art-palette, #taipei-101, #totoro, #pen-tool');
const tooltip = document.createElement('div');

tooltip.classList.add('tooltip');

svgItems.forEach(item => {
  item.addEventListener('mouseenter', (e) => {
    const tooltipContent = e.target.dataset.tooltipContent;
    tooltip.innerHTML = tooltipContent;
    document.body.appendChild(tooltip);
    
    const rect = item.getBoundingClientRect();
    const x = rect.left + rect.width / 2 - tooltip.offsetWidth / 2;
    const y = rect.top - tooltip.offsetHeight - parseFloat(getComputedStyle(tooltip).fontSize) * 1.5;
    
    
    tooltip.style.left = `${x}px`;
    tooltip.style.top = `${y}px`;
    tooltip.style.position = 'fixed';
    tooltip.classList.add('show');

  });

  item.addEventListener('mouseleave', () => {
    tooltip.classList.remove('show');
    tooltip.remove();

  });
});

```

Without Claude, I would have never come up with this from scratch.

### Page transitions & load

<video src="/images/blog/02-portfolio/page-transition.mp4" muted autoplay loop></video>

I used `keyframes` and `animation-delay` to create smooth page transitions. I wanted the nav bar to always be present, so I set the code as follows:

```css

body > *:not(nav) {
    animation: fadeIn 0.75s ease-in;
}

```

Then, for the isometric illustrations, I added `animation-delay` to all of them. This ensures that all the moving illustrations will only start after the page loads. This prevented any weird jitters or flashes.

```css

@keyframes spaceship {
    0% {
        transform: translateY(0);
    }
    50% {
        transform: translateY(-10px);
    }
    100% {
        transform: translateY(0);
    }
}

#spaceship {
    animation-name: spaceship;
    animation-duration: 3s;
    animation-iteration-count: infinite;
    animation-delay: 1.5s;
}

```

Also, a super small detail I implemented was the skeleton image for the tooltip image. This prevented the tooltip from changing its height when loading the image/video.

Here is what it looks like if my portfolio loads on fast 3G wifi: 

<video src="/images/blog/02-portfolio/skeleton-image.mp4" muted autoplay loop></video>


```html

<figure class="tooltip-fig"><div class="skeleton"></div><video class="tooltip-icon" muted autoplay loop src="../images/hero/table-tennis-720s.mp4"></video></figure>

```

You can see in the code that I added a `div` with the class of `skeleton`. I then assigned it a fixed height and a z-index of -1.

```css

.skeleton {
    position: absolute;
    background-color: var(--color-background-secondary);
    width: 100%;
    height: 160px;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    z-index: -1;
    border-radius: var(--border-radius-small);
    animation: loading-skeleton 1s linear 3 alternate;
}

@keyframes loading-skeleton {
  0% {
    background-color: var(--color-background-secondary);
  }
  100% {
    background-color: var(--color-background-tertiary);
  }
}

```

Also, I pre-loaded all the fonts to prevent [FOUT](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/fout) (Flash of Unstyled Text). What happened was, that when I pressed on the navigation, the text flashed once on a new page. The flash is the split second when the system font switches to the intended typeface.

```html

<link rel="preload" as="font" href="/fonts/PlusJakartaSans-Regular.ttf" type="font/ttf" crossorigin>
    <link rel="preload" as="font" href="/fonts/PlusJakartaSans-Medium.ttf" type="font/ttf" crossorigin>
    <link rel="preload" as="font" href="/fonts/PlusJakartaSans-Bold.ttf" type="font/ttf" crossorigin>
    <link rel="preload" as="font" href="/fonts/PlusJakartaSans-SemiBold.ttf" type="font/ttf" crossorigin>

```

Lastly, I wanted to ensure my portfolio runs relatively fast. So, I did the following:

- Optimize images by ensuring all of them are at least under 200KB.
- Added `lazy-loading` ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zzmfjIiC3M&pp=ygUTbGF6eSBsb2FkaW5nIGltYWdlcw%3D%3D)) on all images

### About page - timeline

I created the timeline by following this [written tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_timeline.asp). At first, I thought of doing a zig-zag format. But I changed the timeline to left aligned because zig-zag left too much white space on either side.

![Timeline of Guo's career journey](/images/blog/02-portfolio/timeline.jpg)


### About page - “What I love”

My initial design was a simple image gallery. But, when implementing, I asked myself:

> Why not add a hover caption?
> 

That thought led to the current version. When you hover, you can see more information about the image. Implementing this was one of my favorite parts of the process.

<video src="/images/blog/02-portfolio/hover-on-image-gallery.mp4" muted autoplay loop></video>

## Accessibility

There were also accessibility considerations for my new portfolio.

- Color contrast: WCAG 2.1 Level AA. 4.5:1 for text elements and 3:1 for non-text elements.
- Responsive and fit within a 320px viewport without any loss of content and functionality
- Semantic headings (h1 to h6)
- Alt text for all informative images
- Use of landmarks
- Links are only used to navigate

### Skip to main content

I added a skip to main content button so that keyboard users can skip the navigation. I followed [this article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-add-skip-to-main-content-links-to-a-website/) to implement it.

<video src="/images/blog/02-portfolio/skip.mp4" muted autoplay loop></video>

### Card hover and navigation

> The worst thing you can do for a block link is to wrap everything in the `<a href>`.
> 

As warned by [Adrian Roselli](https://adrianroselli.com/), a well-known accessibility expert, in [this article](https://adrianroselli.com/2020/02/block-links-cards-clickable-regions-etc.html), I made sure to not make this mistake. This is because if you wrap the `<a href>` around the card, the screen reader will read the entire string in the card. This isn't necessary since oftentimes you only need to know the header link.

So, what I did was I wrapped the `<a href>` with the card heading.

```html

<h4>
  <a href="https://www.inko.cat/" target="_blank" class="title-a">Inko Cat</a>
</h4>

```

Then, I applied the following CSS. When the user tabs on each card, it focuses on the heading instead of the entire card. The only downside of this is that users cannot select the text on the card. In this case, that isn’t necessary so it’s fine.

```css

.link-card a[href]::after {
    content: "";
    display: block;
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    bottom: 0;
    left: 0;
    right: 0;
    transition: all 0.3s ease;
}

```

## Future

Last week, I posted my portfolio on [Twitter](https://x.com/guo_hq/status/1779872314366050627) (I don’t think I’ll ever call it X). And to my surprise, it got a lot of traction - 20K impressions. If you’ve been on Twitter long enough, you may think it’s not a lot. But to me, it’s a lot, and I appreciate everyone who took the time to view my portfolio and comment under the tweet.

With the portfolio in a good place, I want to write down some future initiatives.

### Refresh on accessibility

Building this portfolio made me realize:

> Man, I suck at accessibility.
>

Compared to when I was at Pega (3 years ago), I have forgotten a lot of the important accessibility concepts. So, I will retake the [Web Accessibility (Google)](https://www.udacity.com/course/web-accessibility--ud891) course. This was the course my mentor Mike told me to take during my internship.

Accessibility shouldn’t be a checklist. It’s an empathetic way of designing and coding.

### UI experiments

I’ve been following a lot of cool UI experiments. Here are some of my recent favorites:

- [Emil Kowalski](https://emilkowal.ski/)
- [Craft (Rauno Freiberg)](https://rauno.me/craft)
- [uilabs (Mariana Castilho)](https://www.uilabs.dev/)
- [lab (Julien Thibeaut)](https://www.ibelick.com/lab)
- [Interaction Corner (Amelie Schlüter)](https://www.amelieschlueter.com/interactions)

One related video that inspired me recently is “[So You Think You Can Build A Dropdown?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcMYcjtWwVI)” by Pedro Duarte. Such a cool and informative talk. It opened my eyes to the complexity of building a seemingly simple component.

To put it short, I will become a “Designer Who Can Code”. In 2019, this was the title Notion used to hire ([link](https://dribbble.com/jobs/18866-Designer-Who-Can-Code)). It’s too cool to have an idea and know how to make it come to life.

![Designer who can code job listing by Notion](/images/blog/02-portfolio/designer-code.jpg)

And to do that, I will continue to build. And build more. But also, I will be writing more because I believe - it’s important to stop and reflect sometimes.
