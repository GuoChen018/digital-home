## Why a new blog

In my [last blog](https://www.guochen.design/blog/01-life-update), I noted that I will be moving from Webflow to Substack. I listed out several reasons why I’m switching, and I even copied and pasted 68 articles into Substack.

But, after I posted my Substack article on [Twitter](https://x.com/guo_hq/status/1782777051012821133), my tweet engagement was extremely low. And the social preview doesn’t show up. The image below is just an image. It’s not linked to my Substack post.

Confused, I searched online to understand why. And that’s when I learned that:

> Elon does not like Substack ([link](https://www.zdnet.com/article/twitter-vs-substack-feud-everything-you-need-to-know-and-how-it-affects-you/)). So Twitter doesn’t display any Substack social previews.
> 

I’m not sure if my low tweet engagement was because of Substack. But regardless, I needed an alternative. At the time, I thought of two alternatives:

1. Add a domain to my substack blog + pay $50 to do so
2. Build my own blog in my portfolio

Honestly, as a person who loves to build, the second option is a no-brainer. Plus, one of the biggest drawbacks of Substack is the lack of customization. So, I decided to build my own blog.

In this post, I won’t go over the specific details of “how” to build a blog with Astro. There are plenty of amazing resources out there. The ones that helped me the most were

- [Build your first Astro blog (Astro Doc)](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/)
- [Astro Blog Course (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XzyobQYQVQ)

Instead, I will go over my file structure, code component, open graph images, and design of my [blog](https://www.guochen.design/blog/).

## File structure

On the blog level, I have three main files.

1. `post.md` - a single blog post (markdown file)
2. `MainLayout.astro` - template for a blog post
3. `blog.astro` - displays a list of blog posts

### post.md

One of the best parts about Astro supports Markdown files. Also, you can include [frontmatter](https://dev.to/dailydevtips1/what-exactly-is-frontmatter-123g) on top of your markdown. Here is the frontmatter for my [previous post](https://www.guochen.design/blog/02-portfolio/).

```markdown

---
layout: ../../layouts/MainPost.astro

description: "Deep dive into the design and code"
date: 'April 23, 2024'
tags: ['design', 'successes']
thumbnail: /images/blog/02-portfolio/thumbnail.jpg
---

```

Think of frontmatter as data that you can use. The benefit is that you can access these in your layout template. In this case, it’s my `MainPost.astro` file.

### MainPost.astro

This astro file is a template for all my blog posts. This is where frontmatter really shines. I can display `frontmatter.title` and `frontmatter.date` , and it’ll do that for all my posts.

The `<slot />` is where my blog content goes. Lastly, I added a subscribe section with a substack embed at the end of each post.

```javascript

---
const { frontmatter } = Astro.props;
import MainLayout from '../layouts/MainLayout.astro';

---
<MainLayout title={frontmatter.title} description={frontmatter.description} thumbnail={frontmatter.thumbnail}>
    <main class="blog-post">
        <h1>{frontmatter.title}</h1>
        <!-- <h5>{frontmatter.date}</h5> -->
        <slot />

        <section class="subscribe">
            <h4>Want to stay updated?</h4>
            <p>
                Subscribe to my newsletter to get the latest updates on new blog post and cool design finds!
            </p>
            <iframe src="https://guochen.substack.com/embed" width="100%" height="320px" style="border:1px solid #EEE; background:white; border-radius: var(--border-radius-medium); margin-top: 1rem;" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
        </section>
    </main>
</MainLayout>

```

### blog.astro

In this astro file, I display a list of blog posts. To do this, I generate an array of blog posts called `allPosts` using `Astro.glob()`. Then, since I titled my blog posts “00-Name,” I iterated through all of them reversely. This ensures that the most recent post (the highest number) will be displayed first.

For each iteration, I display the title and date of the blog post. After iterating over the entire array, all the blog posts will be displayed. Here is the code below:

```javascript

---
//component imports
import MainLayout from '../layouts/MainLayout.astro'
const {frontmatter} = Astro.props; 
const allPosts = await Astro.glob('../pages/blog/*.md');

---

<MainLayout title="Blog" description='My Blog' thumbnail="/images/og-img.jpg">
  <main class="blog">

    <h1>Blog</h1>
    <ul class="blog-list">
      {allPosts.reverse().map((post) => 
        <li class="blog-row">
          <a href={post.url}>{post.frontmatter.title}</a>
          <p>{post.frontmatter.date}</p>
        </li>)
      }
    </ul>
      
  </main>
</MainLayout>

```

## Astro code block

One of the big additions to my blog is code blocks. At first, I was worried that it would be hard to add them to my content. And I have to say:

> Substack’s code block looks bad.
> 

![Substack’s code block in a post](/images/blog/03-new-blog/substack-code.jpg)

But, Astro saves the day with its [built-in syntax highlighting](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/markdoc/#syntax-highlighting). I was blown away by how easy it is. There are only 2 steps.

### Step 1 - Add this code to your astro.config.mjs

```javascript

import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

// https://astro.build/config
export default defineConfig({
    markdown: {
      shikiConfig: {
        // Choose from Shiki's built-in themes (or add your own)
        // https://shiki.style/themes
        theme: 'dracula',
        // Add custom languages
        // Note: Shiki has countless langs built-in, including .astro!
        // https://shiki.style/languages
        langs: [],
        // Enable word wrap to prevent horizontal scrolling
        wrap: true,
        // Add custom transformers: https://shiki.style/guide/transformers
        // Find common transformers: https://shiki.style/packages/transformers
        transformers: [],
      },
    },
});

```

### Step 2 - Add ``` + specify your language in markdown

It’s that simple. And it looks something like this:

![Javascript code in a markdown file](/images/blog/03-new-blog/code.jpg)

And the result will look like the one below.

```javascript

const svgItems = document.querySelectorAll('#spaceship, #laptop, #ping-pong, #microphone, #cup, #pencil, #cat, #pencil, #art-palette, #taipei-101, #totoro, #pen-tool');
const tooltip = document.createElement('div');

```

> Incredible.

## Open Graph Images

The last part I want to walk through is how I displayed open graph for my blog posts. This was the most challenging part.

[Open graph](https://ogp.me/) is a protocol that lets websites control how to display their content on social media. Below is an example.

![Atlassian CEO sharing an article on Twitter](/images/blog/03-new-blog/open-graph.jpg)

This was the main reason why I moved away from Substack, so I really wanted to get this right.

At first, I added the standard open graph code in my `<head>`.

```html

<meta property="og:title" content={title}/>
<meta property="og:description" content={description}/>
<meta property="og:image" content={thumbnail}/>

```

But, the image preview just won’t show up on Twitter. I searched tons of articles and videos. It just wasn’t working.

Then, I realized two important things that fixed it.

### My og:image is set up incorrectly

This was my code originally:

```html

<meta property="og:image" content={thumbnail}/>

```

Turns out, the `content` needs to be a *link* to the image. My `thumbnail` frontmatter was passing over a file structure - `/images/blog/02-portfolio/thumbnail.jpg`.

So I changed it to the following:

```html

<meta property="og:image" content={`https://www.guochen.design${thumbnail}`}/>

```

This ensured that the content would point to the right image link. An example is https://www.guochen.design/images/blog/02-portfolio/thumbnail.jpg.

### Twitter has a different open graph

For some reason, Twitter likes to be different. There was a separate code I needed to add to show the open graph images on Twitter.

I only realized that after *digging* through the internet and learning about [Twitter Cards](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/cards/overview/abouts-cards). The type I was looking for is a “[Summary Card with Large Image](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/cards/overview/summary-card-with-large-image).”

So, I added this code to my `<head>`.

```html

<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image">
<meta name="twitter:title" content={title}/>
<meta name="twitter:description" content={description}/>
<meta name="twitter:image" content={`https://www.guochen.design${thumbnail}`} />

```

> And it finally worked!

## Design

For the longest time, I’ve always wanted to have a text-only blog page. Some of my favorites are [Brian Lovin](https://brianlovin.com/), [Emil Kowalski](https://emilkowal.ski/), [Catt Small](https://cattsmall.com/blog/), [Ben Borgers](https://ben.page/), [Cap Watkins](https://capwatkins.com/blog), etc.

Also, for reference, this was my previous blog’s design:

![Guo’s previous blog home. It uses bold headers and colorful thumbnails](/images/blog/03-new-blog/old-blog.jpg)

And now, this is the new design:

![Guo’s current blog home. It lists out the blog posts by displaying the title and the date only](/images/blog/03-new-blog/new-blog.jpg)

It’s quite the departure from my previous blog aesthetic. You may like that one better. But personally, at this stage, I prefer the calmness and simplicity of the new blog.

## Putting it all together

My [new blog](https://www.guochen.design/blog/) is live! I’m really happy with the result. And this motivates me to write more because now the blog looks the way I like.
